# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance. Changing the order has an impact on the overall integration
# process, which may cause wedges in the gate later.
# Order matters to the pip dependency resolver, so sorting this file
# changes how packages are installed.  New dependencies should be
# added in alphabetical order, however, some dependencies may need to
# be installed in a specific order.

# Hacking should appear first in case something else depends on pep8
hacking>=3.0.1,<3.1.0 # Apache-2.0

coverage!=4.4,>=4.0 # Apache-2.0
testtools>=2.3.0 # MIT
